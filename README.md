Did this as part of master's program -> deep learning course 

File: main.ipynb serves as the primary code repository.

Dataset: Utilizes FlyingObjectDataset_10K.zip for training and evaluation.

Objective: Aims to accurately segment and reconstruct images, demonstrating the power of U-net in computer vision applications.

Read "unet_segmentation.pdf" for detailed process explanations

Focuses on dividing images into meaningful segments.

Implements a simplified U-net architecture tailored for the segmentation task.

U-net: Specific deep learning architecture known for its effectiveness in image segmentation.

Includes various forms of data augmentation techniques (from https://albumentations.ai/)  to enhance model robustness.
