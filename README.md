Did this as part of master's program -> deep learning course 

File      : main.ipynb serves as the primary code repository.

Dataset   : Utilizes FlyingObjectDataset_10K.zip for training and evaluation.

Objective : Aims to accurately segment and reconstruct images, demonstrating the power of U-net in computer vision applications.

1. Read "unet_segmentation.pdf" for detailed process explanations

2. Implements a simplified U-net architecture tailored for the segmentation task.

3. U-net: Specific deep learning architecture known for its effectiveness in image segmentation.

4. Includes various forms of data augmentation techniques (from https://albumentations.ai/)  to enhance model robustness.
